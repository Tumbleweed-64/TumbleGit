# TumbleGit
A GitHub viewer made with the API.

## What is this?

TumbleGit is an alternative GitHub viewer that utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve profile information and such.

## How was it made?

With my (admittedly not that great) knowledge of PHP, and [curl2PHP](https://incarnate.github.io/curl-to-php/) by @incarnate. This almost definitely would have taken much longer to develop without the aforementioned tool. PHP is really not one of my strongest languages. As usual, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) was a big help.

## How do I use it?

It's pretty simple. If you have a web server installed, just put the folder into your `htdocs` folder. If you don't, I strongly recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). Once you have that, just navigate to the `tumbleGit.html` file with localhost. Then, it's as simple as entering the username of whoever's profile you want to view. From there you can see the user's repos, stars, and all the other great stuff that make GitHub what it is. It will have a much faster load time, however, as it's more minimal than the real GH. That's why I made it. Soon, I'll try to make it so you can create repos and other things you can do on here, but for now it's just a viewer.

# 2024 update

I may do this pretty soon but i don't really like PHP so maybe not
probably gonna just do it in C because C is the best
